# How is Redux-Data different than Redux?
Redux is a store that has methods for:
- dispatching actions that mutation the store through reducer functions
- getting the state of the store.

Redux-Data is a library that helps manage the process of getting data (records) from the server to use on the client.
- allows you to define queries that express the data a component needs, but not how to fetch that data.
